A. Applied clinical knowledge and skills

    Basic pharmacology
        general mechanisms of action of drugs at a molecular, cellular, tissue and organ level & how these actions produce therapeutic and adverse effects
        receptor as a target of drug action and related concepts such as agonism, antagonism, partial agonism and selectivity
        development of tolerance or resistance to drugs

    Clinical pharmacokinetics
        mechanisms of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
        concepts of volume of distribution, clearance and half-life &how these factors determine the optimal route, formulation, dose, frequency and duration of drug administration

    Factors that determine inter-individual variation in drug response
        adherence to therapy, variation in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics & pharmacogenetics

    Monitoring drug therapy
        ways in which this can be achieved (e.g. measuring plasma drug concentrations or assessing pharmacodynamic responses)
        variable relationship between drug dose, plasma concentration and clinical effect

    Adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
        different types of ADRs & frequency of ADRs in primary and secondary care
        common susceptibility factors and how risks of harms can be minimised
        importance of reporting ADRs and other approaches to pharmacovigilance

    Drug–drug interactions
        potential for drugs to interact to cause beneficial OR harmful effects
        mechanisms by which drugs interact (pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic)

    Medication errors
        different types of medication errors & common reasons for medication errors
        ways in which individual prescribers can reduce the risk of medication errors

    Clinical drug toxicology
        assessment, recognition and treatment of common poisonings (e.g. paracetamol)
        understanding of common toxidromes: sympathomimetic, cholinergic, anti-cholinergic, opiate, serotonergic, neurileptic
        principles of decontamination: preventing or counteracting the effects of toxic substances after ingestion
        understanding of substance abuse and drug overdose in a psychosocial context

    Prescribing for special patient groups with altered physiology, pharmacokinetic handling and pharmacodynamic responses
        extremes of age (older adults OR children)
        women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or of child-bearing potential
        patients with renal or liver disease

    Legal aspects of prescribing drugs
        categorisation of drugs as over the counter preparations, prescription-only medicines, controlled drugs
        prescribing of 'unregistered' preparations
        responsibilities associated with prescribing controlled drugs

    Managing the prescribing of medicines in the health service
        role of local formularies & role of drug and therapeutics committees
        influences that affect individual prescribing choices
        rational assessment of new drugs based on safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness

    Ethics of prescribing
        informed patient consent and adherence to therapy

    Commonly used drugs
        the mechanism of action, the indications for use, the appropriate route, frequency and duration of administration, and the important contra-indications and adverse effects of commonly used drugs

    Alternative therapies
        motivations that lead patients to seek alternative therapies
        some common indications and appraisal of the evidence for their efficacy and safety
        how such therapies interact with prescription drugs that patients are receiving

    Drug information retrieval
        Retrieval of drug information for prescribers and other healthcare staff
        Acquisition of knowledge and practice in how to assess the value and reliability of drug information sources

B. Core skills

    Taking a drug history
        taking accurate information about current prescription, non-prescription drugs and complementary medicines
        making an assessment of adherence to a medication regimen
        recording current and past ADRs and allergies

    Prescription writing
        compare and contrast therapeutic options for an individual patient including pharmacological and non-pharmacological options
        choosing a safe and effective drug and an appropriate dose
        prescribing medications under generic and trade names appropriately
        writing accurate, legible and legal prescriptions including controlled drugs
        calculation of drug doses based on patient age, weight, renal function, or a nomogram
        calculation of the strength of an infusion based on the required rate of drug administration
        monitor the effects of drug therapy through drug concentrations, pharmacodynamic responses and/or clinical outcomes, to decide whether to continue, change or cease medicines

    Adverse drug reactions and interactions
        assessing drugs as a possible cause of symptoms and signs
        recognising the potential for adverse interactions
        reporting adverse drug reactions

    Analysing new evidence
        assessing the validity of evidence presented on new drugs or therapies
        reading, assessing and criticising clinical studies
        spotting methodological flaws including sources of bias
        recognising the difference between clinical and surrogate end-points

    Obtaining accurate objective information to support safe and effective prescribing
        using local and national formularies
        accessing reliable drug information from medical journals and medical databases
        accessing Poisons Information Services
        assessing the reliability of varying sources of evidence and opinion
        estimating the benefit and risk of medicines for an individual patient from the evidence, then comparing with observed therapeutic and toxic effects

    Obtaining informed consent to treatment
        providing patients and/or their carers with enough information about drugs to allow them to make informed decisions about their treatment
        discussing benefits and harms of drug therapy with the patients and/or carers
        exploring patients' own individual, social and cultural views and wishes in relation to drug treatment

    Core attitudes
    A rational approach to prescribing and therapeutics
        identifying the correct clinical diagnosis & pathophysiology involved
        knowing the drugs that might beneficially influence these processes acutely and in the longer term
        awareness of the limitations of available therapies
        establishing the end-points with which to monitor therapeutic response
        assessing the potential harms and benefits of treatment
        appreciation of the support available when therapeutic/prescribing problems beyond one’s own knowledge and skills are encountered
        communicating with the patient and/or carer in making the decision to treat
        make clinical decisions based on scientific methods and standards, rather than personal or religious beliefs or financial or other commercial interests

C. Personal and Professional Development (PPD)

    Recognising the responsibilities of a doctor as part of the prescribing community
        avoidance of wasteful prescribing and consumption of limited resources
        controlling the availability of restricted drugs
        adhering to therapeutic guidelines and drug formularies as appropriate
        avoidance of indiscriminate prescribing of antibiotics
        appreciate the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach to therapeutics and particularly to medication safety
