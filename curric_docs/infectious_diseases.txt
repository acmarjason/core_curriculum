A. Clinical diagnosis

    Elicit the signs and symptoms of syndromic infectious diseases problems including:
        Skin and soft tissue infections (cellulitis, abscess)
        Lower respiratory tract infections (bronchitis, pneumonia, empyema) 
        Genitourinary infections (pyelonephritis, lower urinary tract infection, sexually transmissible diseases)
        Gastrointestinal infections (infectious diarrhoea, viral hepatitis)
        Intravascular infections (infective endocarditis, intravascular device associated, malaria) 
        Neurological infections (meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral abscess, epidural abscess) 
        Bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis) 
        Septic shock (meningococcaemia, undifferentiated sepsis)

    Identify the key pathogens implicated in the causation of the above syndromes

    Describe the specific infectious problems associated with particular hosts including:
        diabetic foot infections (contiguous osteomyelitis, infected ulcers)
        hospital-acquired infections (intravascular device-related, UTI, decubitus ulcers, pneumonia, surgical wound infection)
        HIV and associated opportunistic infections  
        febrile neutropenia (acute and chronic neutropenia)  
        splenectomised patients (overwhelming sepsis)  
        intravenous drug users (chronic hepatitis, bacteremia and right sided endocarditis)
        Indigenous Australians and refugee and other migrant populations (STIs, early childhood HBV infection, tuberculosis)

B. History taking

    Elicit a detailed and accurate history of infection/suspected infection paying particular attention to:
        the chronological development of symptoms (these may evolve over a few days in acute infections) 
        epidemiological factors and public health implications
        the potential impact on symptoms of previous antimicrobial therapies or immunizations 
        host immune status
         

    Synthesise the clinical history and examination to develop a differential diagnosis in individual patients

C. Investigations

    Explain the significance of normal microflora, host-parasite relationship and differences between sterile and non-sterile site specimens

    Collect specimen and interpret the results of the following tests:  
        blood cultures (including recognising the significance of contaminated cultures)  
        CSF, pleural and peritoneal fluid (including recognition of the significance of cell counts, protein/glucose values)  
        urine, wound and respiratory cultures (including laboratory assessment of sample quality and interpretation of non-sterile samples)
        aminoglycoside and glycopeptide drug levels

    Understand the principles of serological tests in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, serological markers of recent and past infection and interpret the results of acute and convalescent tests including
        HIV serology
        Hepatitis B and C serology

    Understand the principles of molecular diagnostic tests in the diagnosis and control of infectious diseases and interpretation of PCR based quantitative and qualitative tests

D. Management

    Demonstrate a working knowledge of the prudent use of anti-microbials:  
        appreciate the principles of empirical and microbiology guided narrow spectrum therapy and antimicrobial prophylaxis
        name the major antibiotic drug groups,  and provide examples of classes of antimicrobials, their targets and markers of resistance  
        describe the spectrum of activity, basic pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and the major side effects of commonly used antibiotics

    Understand the empirical treatment of an infectious diseases syndrome based upon consensus guidelines (Therapeutic guidelines)

    Describe infectious disease prevention and Infection Control principles (including the principles of infection transmission, patient isolation, the significance of colonisation with multi-drug resistant pathogens and the impact of staff and patient immunization policies)

    Outline the principles of taking a sexual history in the context of sexually transmissible diseases
