A. Global objectives

    Apply the community and medical descriptors for ‘disability’ (as standardised in the International
    Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, WHO, 2001) incorporating the concepts of
    impairment, activity limitation, participation restriction and contextual factors, as well as ‘support
    needs’

    Plan patient care based on restoration of function, increasing activity and community participation
    within a biopsychosocial framework

    (a) Describe the nature, extent and consequences of disability that can result from dysfunction of the
    i. brain eg stroke, traumatic brain injury, developmental intellectual disability, multiple sclerosis;
    ii. spine eg spinal cord injury, spina bifida
    iii. peripheral nerves eg polio, chronic neuropathic pain;
    iv. musculoskeletal system eg arthritis, back pain, hip and other fractures
    v. peripheral vascular disease and limb amputation;
    vi. heart and lungs eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and
    vii. senses – vision and hearing


    (b) Relate these to the events that can cause this dysfunction such as catastrophic injury, disease,
    genetic and iatrogenic factors

    Apply the best available evidence on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions, such as medication,
    therapeutic exercise, and special procedures, to prevent secondary complications and minimise
    disability following injury, chronic disease and other disorders

    Outline the principles and practice (scope and content of the discipline) of Rehabilitation Medicine

    and sub-acute phases of their hospitalisation

    Outline the specialist role of the Rehabilitation Physician in the non-hospital care of people with
    disability
