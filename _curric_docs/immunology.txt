A. Clinical diagnosis

    Elicit the symptoms & signs of:
        systemic autoimmune diseases
               SLE, Sjogren’s syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis
        organ specific autoimmune diseases
               thyrogastric cluster, liver disease
        vasculitis
               giant cell arteritis
               hypersensitivity vasculitis
               ANCA positive vasculitis
        allergic diseases
            respiratory: asthma, allergic rhinitis
            atopic eczema
             urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis
             food allergy and intolerance
            gastrointestinal, e.g. eosinophilic oesophagitis
               drug reactions
        immune deficiency diseases
               acquired, e.g. , e.g. HIV/AIDS including sero-conversion illness and complicating opportunistic infections Principles of primary immunodeficiencies
               common adult immunodeficiencies (Common Variable Immunodeficiency, IgA deficiency)

    Recognise the following emergencies
    a. anaphylaxis & acute allergic reactions
    b. giant cell arteritis

    Understand:
        the fundamental importance of skilful history taking and competent physical examination.  
        the multisystem nature of autoimmune, allergic & immunodeficiency diseases.
        recognise situations where immune function may be affected (reduced/compromised or altered), e.g. malnutrition, diabetes, therapeutic and recreational drug use, HIV infections, family history of disease, consanguinity 

B. Communication

    Communicate to patients the risks and benefits of immunosuppression, IV immunoglobulin replacement and immunotherapy

    Provide counseling for specific issues in relation to HIV infection, including sexual behaviour and needle and syringe hygiene

    Describe the role of and ethical approach to serological testing of people at high risk of HIV infection in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS

C. Investigations

    Appropriately request and interpret investigations for:
        normal & reduced immune function
            immunoglobulin levels
            EPG, immunofixation for monoclonal bands
            testing for HIV infection
            response to immunization
            peripheral blood T & B cells enumeration by flow cytometry
        autoimmune assessment
            acute inflammatory markers
            autoantibodies in systemic autoimmune diseases (eg ANA, ENA, dsDNA, ANCA, Rheumatoid factor) and complement levels
            autoantibodies in organ-specific autoimmune diseases (eg Pernicious anaemia, Liver disease, Coeliac disease)
            recognizing B cell hyperactivity 
        allergy assessment
            importance of history
            skin prick testing
             specific IgE (RAST)
             total IgE
            patch testing
            intradermal testing
             provocation testing (e.g. food allergens, inhalant allergens, drugs)
            testing of lung function, bronchial hyperreactivity, airway inflammation
            dietary elimination and challenge testing

D. Management

    Understand the therapeutic options for
        systemic autoimmune diseases
            use and side-effects of  corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and biological immune modulators, and prevention of their complications
        immunodeficiency diseases
            intravenous immunoglobulin
        HIV/AIDS, including use of anti-retroviral therapy and prophylactic therapy against opportunistic infections
        allergic diseases
            avoidance, pharmacotherapy, immunotherapy

    Initiate treatment for immunological emergencies, e.g. anaphylaxis, giant cell arteritis
