This repo stores flashcards relevant to the SMP Stage 3 in 2013-14.

The idea will be that flashcards relevant to each of the sections of the core
curriculum will be added here.
Flashcards are text-only at this stage.
Some curriculum areas are likely unsuited to text-only flashcards (Imaging 
comes to mind) so these areas may be skipped.

Cards are to be in comma separated value (csv) format. You'll need to save
these in something other than Microsoft Excel, as it doesn't play nicely
with Anki. 
I recommend LibreOffice Calc. 
It can be found here: http://www.libreoffice.org/download/

Anki is the spaced repetition software that beats the answers
to these cards into one's brain. 
It can be found here: http://ankisrs.net/anki2.html

I'll add the core curriculum docs in here soon.
It would be nice to have each one arranged as a checklist.
